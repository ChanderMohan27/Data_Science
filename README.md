# Data_Science Project

Welcome to the Data_Science project, a machine learning initiative leveraging MLOps principles and implementing Data Version Control (DVC).

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning solution utilizing the ElasticNet model. The objective is to predict wine quality based on various parameters.

## Key Features

- **MLOps Integration:** The project incorporates MLOps concepts for efficient development, deployment, and management of machine learning models.
  
- **Data Version Control (DVC):** We use DVC to handle data versioning, ensuring reproducibility and efficient management of datasets.

- **Parameter Management:** The project adopts a modular approach with the use of `parameters.yaml` files. This allows easy access to parameters, facilitating modifications and enhancing project flexibility.

- **Reusability:** Leveraging reusable functions and components to create an end-to-end project that adheres to Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) principles.

## Flask Web Application

To enhance user interaction, a Flask web application has been integrated into the project. This provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the machine learning model.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install project dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore and modify the `parameters.yaml` files for easy customization.
4. Run the Flask web application to interact with the machine learning model.
